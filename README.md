# rsync_MD5

A side project to utilise rsync and MD5 to check file / folder differences across servers.

The idea is that MD5 check sums will be generated and stored in database table which can be used as part of an SP and report on differences.

The rsync, a linux utility, can highlight differences between files and these will added to a report.
